# About

-   Animations are created using [p5.js](https://p5js.org/)
-   Animations are captured with [CCapture.js](https://github.com/spite/ccapture.js/)
-   Math is rendered at [latex2png](http://latex2png.com/)
-   The website is generated by [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (which might be a little overkill...)

## How to Use

1. Run `yarn dev` to start the webserver.
2. Preview the animation at `/[animation]`.
3. To download the frames, go to `/[animation]/capture`.
4. Tranform the frames into a `.gif`, e.g., with `ffmpeg`.

## Adding Animations

To create an animation called `new_animation`:

1. Write the script in `/public/animations/[new_animation]/script.js`.
2. It will be accessible at `/[new_animation]` and capturable at `/[new_animation]/capture`.
3. You can then add metadata for the animation at `/data/[new_animation].md`.
